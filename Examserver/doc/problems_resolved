It is the first time that I have installed examserver in my laptop and figured out the following problmes

1. Servername is not set throughout the page.
2. Session is last in the some web pages
3. First time testing in the Fedora-8 and I have planned to test the subsequent releases as a seperate installation and will make it out as a big success.
4. Model Exam is tested with time out period of 30 seconds. 

Wait Guys.
This product is on the way to make a great impact.
